# Absenteeism
Final group project - Attendance data analysis

## Topic

Attendance (Absenteeism): What factors influence Absenteeism? What trends exist within attendance?

In the database branch, there is a file called Absentismlocation1.sql. This file includes the original chart we imported from Kaggle and two modified tables that look and location characteristics and the personal attributes of the absentee hours. The tables are Absenteeism (which is the original table), Absenteeismlocation1 (which looks at the characteristics of the store locations), and Absenteeismpeople (which has the personal attributes of the people).
